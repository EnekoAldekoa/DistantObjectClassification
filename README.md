# DistantObjectClassification
### Classification of Stars, Galaxies and Quasars. Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17

----

I found this dataset on kaggle and I am using it to practice some machine learning coding. 

## Main.py

The main.py script contains a random forest that is fastly trained and gets good accuracy (%97).

## SMOTE.py

On the SMOTE.py script I tried to use a support vector machine but failed on the attempt to achieve acceptable accuracy.
